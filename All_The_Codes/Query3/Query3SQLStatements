--This is Query3 SQL Statements 
--Unlike previous query, Method 1(R-Tree) and Method 2(Linear Scan) doesn't have separate SQL Statemetns, since 
--this query only look for accident within region and look for accident duration(difference), which doesn't need distance calculation,
--so we don't need to create another sets of SQL statements for Linear Scan 

--Case 1
select id, EXTRACT(EPOCH From (end_time-start_time)) as difference 
from accident
where accident.geom && ST_MakeEnvelope(-121.517834,38.556757,-121.474902,38.588344,4326)
Order by difference 




--Case 2
select id, start_time, end_time,EXTRACT(EPOCH From (end_time-start_time)) as difference 
from accident
where accident.geom && ST_MakeEnvelope(-121.935904,37.242877,-121.840773,37.356559,4326)
Order by difference
